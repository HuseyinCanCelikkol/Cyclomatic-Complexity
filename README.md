# What's That?

Cyclomatic Complexity is a way to learn how complex is your code. It simply shown in a graphic kind of these:

So if you inspect well, there's a closed places where surrounded by edges and consisted by conditions and loops. That's what we searched for. We'll sum those places or 
we'll sum conditions and loops on our code.

So that code just finds if, while, for,'?', "&&", "||", case:, default:  operators to find complexity of your code. 

I add "switch case" condition structure to find now. 

I thought like If we write a perfect code, after we can find of Its complexity. So that gives me good vibes about not struggling to mop up other code murderers back.

So put "perfect" codes inside of temp.txt to find something logical or just go k*** y***

Anyway, feel free to use that code. It really works well. I struggled with it so much (about 1-2 hours lmao)
